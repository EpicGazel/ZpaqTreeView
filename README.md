# ZpaqTreeView
Allows browsing and extraction of a zpaqfranz archive in a tree/hierarchical file structure view.

It can be a pain to browse through the contents of a zpaq as they are output in an unwieldy list. As such, I've cleaned up the list output by putting it into a tree structure and allowing the browsing and extraction of folders and files.

Note: Will need treelib from pip to run the code. Will also need to have zpaqfranz available in the path the code is run in.
